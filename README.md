Java code for aiming Yagi antenna from latitude, longitude, and elevation

The algorithm for computing the polar vector between a pair of latitude, longitude, elevation coordinates was taken directly from Don Cross, whose work was greatly appreciated. The source can be found at https://github.com/cosinekitty/geocalc, and a very informative article explaining his methodology can be found at https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/calculating-azimuth-distance-and-altitude-from-a-pair-of-gps-locations-36b4325d8ab0.
Because this project is in Java, this segment could be considered a port of his JavaScript code into Java.
